## Introduction

This project is a recreation of the Apple website. I made a deliberate effort to maintain as much similarity as possible to the original pages while creating all components and styling from scratch. Unfortunately, only 3 pages have been replicated completely but if inspected you will notice that the similarities are uncanny. Due to this degree of attention to detail, the creation of additional pages is a very time consuming ordeal and heaped on top of this: Apple updates it's website constantly. Despite the current standing of incompletion relating to this project, I still believe that it has been a personal success. My original goal was to learn how to confidantly navigate React and its technical intricacies such as Hooks and Routing.

This project was created using React and VanillaJS.
